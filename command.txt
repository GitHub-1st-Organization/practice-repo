2. "code command.txt" will open the command.txt file inside the vs code editor which is different than vim or nano editor.
3. "git log" command is used to show recent git commits to the git tree... FYI to save changes in the nano editor press Ctrl + O (letter O) and press Enter and to exit press Ctrl + x(letter x).
